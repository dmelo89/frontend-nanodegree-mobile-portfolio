## Overview

For this project I used [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) to help me with the main Gulp tasks to build the project and do all the steps for optimizing page performance (minification and etcetera). 




## Quickstart

Clone this repository and build on what is included in the `app` directory.

You'll need to have NodeJs in your enviroment.

You'll have to use `npm install` to install dependencies

Build the repository using the `gulp` command.

## Making changes to the project

Use the `app` directory for editing any code, and then use `gulp serve` command to serve these files.
